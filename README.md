# webcrawlerhttp
Repo for third project on boot.dev - Learn HTTP course.

JavaScript was used to build this webcrawler, which finds every embedded webpage within a website. These tools are often used for search query engines.

This tool is meant to be run on the console, and it prints a "report" showing all embedded links and its corresponding hits.

If you wish to use this tool, feel free to fork!

To get started, install dependencies with:
```
npm install
```

Then run the following command in the terminal:
```
npm start [website URL]
```
